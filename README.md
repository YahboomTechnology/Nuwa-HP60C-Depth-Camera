# Introduction
Nuwa-HP60C depth camera is a high-performance 3D vision device designed for robots, AR/VR and other fields. It possess 73.8° large FOV, 4M depth range, and 0.2M ultra-small blind area. Adopt advanced structured light technology, combined with high-resolution imaging sensors, achieve accurate depth measurement and high-quality 3D modeling. Its compact design and wide compatibility make it an ideal choice for positioning various intelligent systems and robot end effectors.

# Features
* Wide field of view

1) 73.8° FOV, with a larger coverage range, is suitable for target recognition and tracking in complex environments.

2) 4M effective depth measurement range, long-distance scenes still maintain accurate measurement.

3) 0.2M smaller blind area design, ensures seamless data collection when working at close range to meet the needs of precision operations.

* Advanced technology and excellent performance

1) Structured light technology remains highly stable in different lighting environments.

2) High-resolution imaging sensors provide more delicate depth maps and color data, making 3D modeling and object recognition clearer.

* Highly integrated and easy to use

1) Size is 89.8mm*25mm*19mm, easy to install. It can be mounted on the robot end effector, drone or mobile device.

2) Supports mainstream development platforms (such as ROS, OpenCV) and operating systems (such as Windows, Linux), which is convenient for developers to quickly integrate and secondary development.

3) SDK and development documents will be provided, can make project deployment more efficient.
